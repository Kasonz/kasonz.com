      <h1 class="pt-4">No Hello</h1>
      <h2 class="display-3 pt-1">
        Please Don't Say Just Hello/Hi In Chat
      </h2>
      <p>
        Trying to be polite by not jumping right into the questions, like we would do in person or on the phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Chat is neither of those things, typing is much slower than talking - and I'm not a fast typer ðŸ˜…
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead
        of
        being polite, you are just
        making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity.
      </p>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b> Focus on efficiency</b>: "For a faster response, feel free to jump right into your question or request."
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Highlight clarity</b>: "To best assist you, please include your question or request with your initial
        message."

      </p>
      </p>

      <p><b>Offer context</b>: "If you'd like to check if I'm available first, you can say 'Hey Kason, quick question
        about...' "
      </p>

      <p>

        Moreover, posing your question before awaiting a response enables asynchronous communication. This means that if
        the other party is unavailable and you leave before their return, they can still respond to your inquiry rather
        than simply encountering a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.
